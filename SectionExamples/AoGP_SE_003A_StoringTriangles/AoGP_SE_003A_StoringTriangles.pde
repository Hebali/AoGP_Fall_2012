  // One of the nice things about OpenGL triangles as opposed to triangle strips (which we'll look at in later examples)
  // is that triangles can be aligned with one another to appear as a coherent mesh or detatched from one another entirely.
  // We can, of course, also transition between these states, allowing for effects that imitate explosions, objects breaking, etc.
  // Partly because of this versatility, however, we have to be careful about how we store and access triangles and the vertices
  // that compose them. In this example, we'll begin to develop a class for the storage and management of multiple triangles.
  // We'll also look at some of the problems and limitations associated with this approach as we move towards integrating a generalized
  // geometric storage structure with the scenegraph nodes from earlier examples.

      // Create two triangles for each subdivision, triangles ABD and CBD.

      //triContainer.addTriangle( new Tri( vertC, vertB, vertD ) );
      // Triangles ABD and CBD are now sharing vertices B and D, preventing us from moving
      // each triangle individually.
      
      // In some cases, shared vertices may be useful. For instance, in a mesh surface,
      // when we move a vertex, we want all of the attached triangles to move with it.
      // In the above method, however, only some of the vertices are shared.
      // The problem is in how we're iterating over the rectangular subdivisions.
      // In the following diagram:
      // A---B---E---F
      // |   |   |   |
      // C---D---G---H
      // We will touch subdivision ABCD, then BEDG, then EFGH, etc.
      // Notice that vertex B and D are in both of the first two subdivisions.
      // However, in the above method, even if we share vertices between the two
      // triangles of each subdivision, we are not sharing them between subdivisions.
      // In the next example stage, we'll look at a method for sharing vertices between subdivisions.
