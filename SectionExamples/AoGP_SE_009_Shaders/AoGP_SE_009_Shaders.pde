  // In this section example, we look at shaders and some data structures for assisting with their use.
  // A lot of the new material for this example is within the ShaderManager tab. Please take a look at the notes and code there.
  // The general goal of these shader management structures is as follows:
  // Managing assets - images, videos, shaders, etc - within an application is a task that often spirals out of control
  // over the course of a project's development. This is particularly true of projects that require a quick
  // turn-around or go through a series of radical design changes over a short period.
  // Though it's not particularly fun, it will save time and frustration later to build a simple asset management system.
  // Shaders come with their own variables and runtimes, so it is an area that can be particularly benefitted by your working out
  // a management system that fits the nature of your software. In this example, we've added a bunch of "built-in" shaders
  // that can be easily attached to an object. Having a collection built-in shaders is a very useful in quickly sketching out a scene or world.
 
  // One of the interesting things about shaders is that we can apply different ones to different objects in our scene
  // to compose a world filled with objects rendered by starkly different principles. We could have a realistically lit object
  // positioned alongside a toon-shaded object or one that is rendered with hatching. It's an aesthetic mashup of the highest order.
  // Since shaders can set the position of vertices, camera model, lighting and coloring of an object,
  // there is an opportunity for a sort of GLSL cubism. That is, we can fracture and fragment the way we visualize an environment, we can apply numerous visual styles, etc.
  // We can also use this feature more conventionally to simulate a variety of materials we might find in the real world - shiny ones, matte ones, metallic ones, etc.

  // We now initialize the renderer with "GLConstants.GLGRAPHICS" rather than "OPENGL":
  size( 800, 600, GLConstants.GLGRAPHICS );
  
  // Initialize the SceneController. The controller will need access to the PApplet
  // object and the renderer contained within it, so we pass the PApplet in here.
